### 👨‍🎓 How to

1.  📦 **Initial Setup.**

    ```shell
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    yarn install
    ```

1.  🔨 **Start the devserver.**


    ```shell
    yarn run develop
    ```

1.  🎉 **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    All CSS and JS/TS should be automatically reloaded when you edit them!
    If you delete an existing file or change something in the `gatsby-*.*` files, you'll need to restart your devserver!

1.  🚀 **Build and deploy!**

    ```shell
    yarn build
    ```

    Then just copy the contents of the `public/` folder.
    TODO: setup continuous deploy.
